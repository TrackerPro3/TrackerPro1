Note 1: California claimants, this notice is being sent because there has been no customer activity in the past 2 years.
Note 2: North Carolina claimants, if satisfactory proof of claim is not presented by the owner to Test Entity Name by April 1st of the current year, for life
insurance property, or October 1st of the current year for non-life insurance property, the property will be placed in the custody of North Carolina’s
Treasurer, to whom all further claims shall be directed. Please do not contact the state until after January 1st for non-life insurance property and July 1st for
life insurance property; this is to allow the state time to process the report of unclaimed property. Once property is placed in the custody of the Treasurer, all
interest, dividends, income, and gains earned on the property will remain with the Treasurer, even if the owner subsequently reclaims the property from the
Treasurer.
